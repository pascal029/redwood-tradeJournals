# README

This project is in development stage. I make this project to learn Redwoodjs framework.
The app is actually quite simple. The idea is coming when i realize i was trading since 2017 and feels like there is no progress and stuck over there because i don't have any journals.
This app will help user(in this case trade) write their trading rules, plans, and journals them.
